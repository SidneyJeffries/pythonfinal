      <td id="T_a818a_row0_col0" class="data row0 col0" >I grew up around the corner from this library and spent a great deal of time in<br>it. It was in need of expansion in the 90s and I really hope the city builds a<br>great library there as the residents really deserve it. The article makes it<br>sound like the residents have no real point and are just trying to block<br>housing, but I think they're right on this one. For me, the library was a safe<br>escape from the streets. It can't be that if it is placed within PHA housing --<br>and I mean that in the nicest way possible. Having grown up in N. Philly it<br>isn't a section of the city where there is a lack of land for affordable housing<br>development. I was there for Street's Neighborhood Transformation Initiative<br>where they bulldozed scores of vacant houses to create massive lots. Which was a<br>welcome change as it made walking down many streets safer... Building on lots<br>like those makes more sense to me than this proposal. The city needs to increase<br>the options available for kids to have positive places to seek refuge and the<br>city needs to really invest in ways that show black kids, especially, that we're<br>more than just set pieces to entertain others. Meaning, the city can invest in<br>more than the REC center or sports in neighborhoods like N. Philly. Just my $.02</td>
